  <div class="text">To my love</br>Phiwe Gumede </br>Sthandwa sami MaPhakathwayo
I’ve been sitting with this for too long and I realized how much of your heart you’ve given me. 
<br>I know I missed the exact moment of when you wanted this to be delivered, it's taken a while to create this and I hope it shows you exactly what you mean to me. 
<br>You told me that meeting me was your most beautiful discovery, but the truth is discovering you has been the greatest blessing of my life. 
You call me your healer and your superhero but you are the one who has given me a reason to be the best version of myself. 
When you feel scared that I might seek satisfaction elsewhere, please know this: I have already found everything I ever prayed for in you. You are my princess the only woman I want to walk through this life with.
<br>I love your attitude, your moods, and even the way you overthink, because it all belongs to the woman I’ve chosen. You are the prize I am proud to hold onto. 
I don’t want to just be your boyfriend for a season, I want to be the man who keeps your heart safe and warm for the rest of our lives.
<br>I love you, MaGumede. Not just on Valentine's Day, but every single hour that you occupy my thoughts.
Yours forever,
Sabelo Zulu!</div>
